 * lookup3 : This file does no looking up locally, but instead asks

 * The server sits listening on a "well-known" named pipe
 * (this is what is passed to lookup3 as resource)
 * The Client sets up a FIFO for reply, and bundles the FIFO
 * name with the word to be looked up. (See Client in dict.h)
 * Care must be taken to avoid deadly embrace (client & server
 * both waiting for something which can never happen)
