Lex 版本:
$ flex --version
flex 2.6.0

作業平台:
$ uname --all
Linux wu1604-VirtualBox 4.4.0-70-generic #91-Ubuntu SMP Wed Mar 22 12:47:43 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

執行方式:
$ make
flex B033040006.l
gcc lex.yy.c -lfl
$ ./a.out < test1.java
$ ./a.out < test2.java
$ ./a.out < test3.java

如何處理這份規格書上的問題:

上網找有關 lex 的語法教學，尋找看有沒有 C 的範例 lex 文件，並思考在 Java 有哪些可能出現的合法或不合法的情況

寫這個作業所遇到的問題:

在 Windows 下的換行字元或多個 \r，且因為 Regular Expression 中的 . 或包括到 \r，所以要特別拿出來處理

所有測試檔執行出來的結果，存成圖片或文字檔:
